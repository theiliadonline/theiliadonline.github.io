<h1><div class="article1_head"> 30 Ways to Tell if Your Friends Give a Sh*t About You</div></h1>
No, but seriously. They really, really, really love you.

## **1. Noam Altman-Kurosaki**
Hey there QT,

How you doing. Eating right? Gawsh, you look like the skin's falling off of your
bones. Hon, could you get our boy a burger? I swear, these days all people do is
 work work work...

Anyway, Almog told me to send you some corny shit, so I had to get a few drinks
 in me first.

But actually, happy birthday, big boy. You'll probably never hear it from anyone
 else, but thank you for keeping the team together the past couple of years.
 Shit could've fallen apart way worse than they did, but if divers didn't step
 up, we'd essentially have two separate teams. God knows the swimmers won't do
 shit to reach out.

Moving on to other shit, I remember seeing you do some gymnastic shit during
Clash of the Colleges your Freshman year, and thinking "that guy could probably
walk on." Luckily Adam and Lewis had my back, and spoke to you before I even
knew your name. Since then, you've gone from untapped potential, to qualifying
for zones, to actually competing at zones; my body burnt our before I could get
 to that last bit. That's a big accomplishment for anyone, let alone someone
 that's only been in the sport for a few years.

I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm extremely proud of how far you'e come.
Just by showing up to that first pre-game after you joined the team, I knew you
would become a leader in your own right. Admittedly, that's a shitty metric,
but if it works, it works. Congrats on retirement. When you're rich, come visit
me in Hawaii some time. Or wherever. Seriously, I'm lonely. Just roll through.

XOXO,
Dad

Happy birthday young Samuel Robert Chihuahua!!! You are 22 years of age.
You can now legally apply to adopt a child, how exciting!! I'm sure you've
had some crazy and unforgettable times in the past 22 years and I'm glad I've
got to make some mems with you for the past 3. Allow me to share some mems
with you now: it was the very first night of frosh week for the wide-eyed 18
year old Christian Feiler. Hopes were high for my very first college party.
The cloister backyard moisture was all very novel, and I was having the time
of my life. This is where you come in. Some weirdo attacked me and berated me
for not accepting his friend request on Facebook. At the time, I thought this
was just some mentally feeble, possibly deranged Princeton student that
mistook me for someone else. Oh, how I was wrong. It turned out to be none
other than Mr. Sam Chiacchia -- the arch tennis rival of my dear cousin Aidan.
From then on we've began forming some unforgettable memories. From the time
you and Yaz came to boulder for a day trip and convinced me to buy last
minute tickets to Flume for my first red rocks show (you are responsible for
turning me into a wook), to enjoying a nice hoagie and milk with the boys,
we have had some great times. Enjoy the day and know we have some more great
times ahead of us. Love you baby. Viel Glück zum Geburtstag!

Re: Sam’s gift

When we ran into each other at the junior house in Puerto Rico and both lost
our shit

And we were so excited to see each other lmao

Hbd Sam!!!!!!

## **4. Alex Lewis**

It’s been so much fun being weird with you these last four years. Everyone has
something to bring to the party: some people bring the newspaper, some people
bring the kindling… you bring the fire (cheesy AF I know). You’re the fire that
warms me up when I’m feeling down. You light me up when you drop some FKJ on
Saturday night at 2 AM. And you’re the fire when I’m gasoline… and thats when
we make some of the dumbest decisions ever. Good thing you can’t spell dumbest
without -best, so let’s keep being childish fools. Happy birthday Sam!!

## **5. Aaron Ach**

Call for help if you stoop to the litterbox <3 -Aaron

## **6. Alex Peters**

HBD brother, we old.

Without the late nights at the top of Blodgett or the cigars in GoG, we probably
wouldn't have made it this far.
You have a clear record and are about to graduate from Princeton - guess it was
a good call on you and Michael hiding in my bed when cops showed up to the house
after we almost broke the back window of that lady's Lexus, bitch.
90% of the good stories I have from Colorado (shoutout Shire) came from the
stuff we used to pull. People are always confused but jealous they didn't come
up with slingin (RIP Chariot) as a way to spend Friday and Saturday nights.

Thanks for being a brother to me, without you I wouldn't know what Amarillo,
Tejas looks like, I wouldn't know what it's like to bring Camelbaks full of beer
to grad parties, and I'd probably be working at Journey's selling DC shoes in
the Citadel Mall with Cole Long.

Proud of you homie, happy birthday.
Love, AP

## **7. Chris Grubbs**

Happy birthday Cha! Has been incredible being friends with you over the years.
From our time on west Windsor, to finding the that good good on the beach in the
DR, to Jackson hole, our friendship has incredible memories that I won't soon
forget! 😘😘

## **8. Mark Goldstein**

Most people refer to long-lasting friendships at Princeton as “Day 1”
friendships, and our friend group even has a “Day 1’s” snap group, but Sam and
I actually met on our first day on campus, for OA. That said, I wouldn’t say we
were “Day 1” boiz. My first experience with Sam was watching as our OA leader
confiscated his benedryl and her and Sam had a very public, incredibly awkward
standoff in the middle of a Whitman study room. I was pretty rattled and
thought, “who the fuck is this kid.” What’s nice about OA is that instead of
avoiding this dude like the plague after that, I was forced to spend 5 days with
him in the woods, and it was the start of a really incredible friendship. Since
that inauspicious Day 1, we’ve been in the same draw group every year, joined
the same eating club together, visited each other’s homes, and bonded over our
shared affinity for Greek yogurt, quality memes, and being both incredibly nerdy
and incredibly stupid. I’m forever grateful that he was in fact allowed to come
on our OA trip despite his addiction to antihistamines, and I’m excited to close
out our Princeton careers together, just like we started them. Happy 22 to the
kid.

## **9. Will Haynes**

Dearest Samuel,

What a pleasure it has been to be your friend these last few years. In them you
have given me memories for a lifetime. Together we have fought our way out of a
spider’s web, battled Snorlax in his cheese forest, navigated an east coast full
of Troiani’s (twice), and suffered double leg craps mere hours into skiing (that
was just me actually).

Thank you for all of the adventures. I’m excited to make more with you during
our last few months at Princeton. Happy birthday brother, I love you.

## **10. Nathan Makarewicz**

Sam, what's good ho? I hope you're doing well and I can't wait to chill with you
at reunions.  Happy birthday buddy. Finish this year strong

## **11. Grant Keating**

Some of my favorite memories with ChaCha are from two summers ago when he lived
in Boston with Gordon. From weekly dinners and drinks at Felipe, to two hour pho
lunch breaks, to JP Licks Coffee Oreo, to blacking out on random Tuesday nights,
every day we spent together was a blast. There are very few people in this world
who can go from groundbreaking medical research to bumping Chill Bill while
facing a bowl. Happy Birthday kid, love you to death and proud to call you a
friend.

## **12. Peter Holt**

Sam,
Happy birthday!  I hope it’s a great one, and you should definitely eat a lot of
beers.  I was thinking this week about my trip out to Colorado last summer;
actually, I think about it a lot.  I know it was just a couple of days doing fun
stuff, but it was great to meet your family and chill in the hot tub and in the
mountains.  Most of all, I enjoyed hearing about all you have planned and where
you want to go in medicine and in life.  You got some big dreams, buddy, but as
you proved on Quandary, scaling mountains is what you do best.  I have no doubt
you’ll crush the mountains you set for yourself moving forward, and I can’t wait
until you get to the top and make a huge difference in this world.  If you ever
need any help getting there, you know I’ll do everything I can to give you a
hand (depending on the state of the Asian markets). I wouldn’t trade our
friendship for anything, and I hope I’m always involved in whatever ridiculously
cool thing you’re doing with your life.  You’re an incredible friend and you got
a big heart.  I know neither of those things will ever change.  I hope this year
is unbelievably special for you, and I’m looking forward to absolutely crushing
this spring with ya.

Sincerely,
Peter

## **13. Michael Manhard**

Yo dude,

You're getting old. Just like me.

But seriously, happy birthday! It's been too damn long since we've caught up,
and I miss you. On top of that, it seems like a ton has happened since last
time, so I'm looking forward to the next time I hear from you.

Ever since you finished up at zones, I've been meaning to send over my thoughts
and (probably ill-advised) life advice. Expect to hear from me about that soon,
but for now, I wanted to say that I'm damn proud of you for what you
accomplished in such a short career. It might not have been the ending you
dreamed of, but I'm happy you took it through to the end and kept pushing even
after a million roadblocks.

Now that you're an old retired NARP who's soon to graduate, let's do some stupid
shit. Let me know if you're down to climb Annapurna or make a gastronomy
startup. I'm thinking we can do something that someone will write a book about
someday. Let's brainstorm and see what we can make happen.

Love you, man. Excited to see what the future holds for you, and happy birthday!

Michael

PS Yasmeen is pretty aight for setting this up. She hounded my ass to get me to
write this on time (AKA she's a keeper).

## **14. Gina DiVittorio**

Dear Sam,
We weren't really friends in high school, but we are now and that's what's
important. My fondest with you was when we for some reason ended up watching
Lord of the Rings with Sean Weller and Rachel Samuels and you coined the phrase,
"You don't travel to Mordor without getting a little gay." Anyways, against all
the odds of being from Colorado Springs you've turned out to be a great kid and
I think you've got a lot of great stuff ahead of you.

## **15. Sara Horne**

Sam!!

Thought you might be sick of reading a bunch of nice things about yourself, so
this note will just be a tribute to the late, great Admiral Ackbar.  Gone too
soon.  Who knew so many jokes, memories, memes would come out of our trip to
that movie??  You’re such a wonderful person and it’s been so amazing getting
closer with you and all of the guys over the past four (!!) years.  You can
always put a smile on my (and everyone else’s) face, which is just the best.  
You have so many amazing things ahead of you and I’m so excited we get to be
there to watch your incredible achievements.  You guys are all so special to me
and I’m so thankful for you!!!  Hope you have the best birthday.  Looking
forward to all the years of Catan to come.

Sara

## **16. Chuck Kalvaria**

cha, can’t believe its already been three years of knowing you. I remember
freshman year you were just that random kid in our fantasy football league
because you were someones friends friends friend and you ended up crushing us
all. Pledging with you was a blast. I remember walking back down washington
just u and me and M&H because we had midterms the next day. That’s when we knew
what we’d become. Great getting to know you buddy love you have a great day

## **17. Wyatt Navarro**

Happy birthday, samwise. We only have a few more months before the real world
but I’m trying to spend as much of those months watching Taylor swift music
videos with the boys as possible. Congratulations on 4 years of successfully
falling on your head and I hope you use some of your newfound free time to chill
with your day ones. Enjoy your birthday, bro.

## **18. Colleen McHugh**

Remember when we went to the Taylor Swift concert? I was always a fan, so when
you invited me I was super excited. Of course, when we got there and found our
seats at the front of the stage my jaw dropped a bit. It didn’t even matter that
we were totally sober by then—it was the most fun I’ve ever had at a concert. I
feel like that was the true blossoming of our  friendship… It has only gotten
better and weirder and tighter from then, so thanks for opening that door. You
are a brother to me, something that has been incredibly special and valuable to
me during our time here. Much love, Colleen.

## **19. Michael Sheldon**

Ya sorry it took so long I've been on a bender this weekend but just tell him I
said lemme get uhhhhhh happy birthday, boi!

## **20. Gordon Moore**

Two summers ago I rented a house in Boston with a Harvard Masters student I
didn’t know (and his little brother), a Berkeley lightweight rower I didn’t
know, and Sam. I didn’t know what to expect when I drove up to move in, but I
was not expecting to embark on one of the best summers of my life. Sam truly
made that summer a summer to remember. For a guy who’s no doubt going to change
the world through medicine, Sam certainly knows how to have fun outside the lab.
Whether it was a turn up Tuesday leading to a missed workday, dinner and margs
at border cafe, caps in the living room, a couple bowls on the back porch, or a
run to Felipe’s and jp licks, I knew that when I left work I was going to be
having an amazing time. Sam single-handedly got me through the workday every day
for eight weeks. Love you Cha and have an amazing birthday.

## **21. Aimee Foster**

Happy birthday my darling, Sam! I wish you all the happiness in the world for
this next year! You are such a sensational human being, and I am beyond grateful
for your friendship every day.

Thank you for always being such a joy within our pack. You make all of us
better. And if you were to ever lead a cult, I would totally follow.

So much love for you and best wishes for your birthday!

## **22. Tyler Kaye**

Love you boy. Cant wait for the next few weeks to help you understand how great
the NARP life can be. We have had some awesome times and I can’t wait for many
more. Will always remember our times shredding some good powder in Beaver and
finding some other good stuff on the beach in Puerto Rico. Your energy is
infectious and I can’t wait for many more (plus I still thank you every day for
being the only one to tell a tame story of me at dinner with my parents in
Colorado).

## **23. Zach Ridout**

Salutations,

Happy Birthday! It was great seeing you at Ivy's, let's do that again soon!
Specifically wearing sick glasses and dabbing like it's 2016 (my peak year).

Hope you're doing well and thriving as the sun comes around the corner and you
start to see the daybreak of spring. Some of my best memories were from lounging
around and enjoying the last few months I had at Princeton doing whatever I
wanted, you should do the same.

Also, 22 is a sick age, it's the pinnacle of youth. You're way more mature than
lame ass 21 year olds drinking 40s and smoking weed like it's cool. You're in
college, but you're also out of college with all the fun of being in college.
You're cool, you make the money, you roll the nickels, so own it. Plus it's
still acceptable to be attracted to 18 year olds. (Sorry Yasmeen)

Have a good year man, see you in 2.5 months.

## **24. Jess Hendricks**
happy birthday sam! I can’t believe it’s been four years since we were getting
drunk in our parents basements and hydroplaning in clifford while jammin our to
our girl t.swift. 22 looks good on you! have another fun trip around the sun :^)
xx jess!

## **25. Scott Bechler**

What’s up dude. Happy fuckin birthday. Remember that night of reunions when you
got punched in the face and then later were pulling trig and projectile vomiting
into the trash can amidst a circle of zetes? Have that mentality again tonight.
And always, really. I know you’re balls deep in your thesis right now and
focusing on all the shitty parts of it but don’t forget to admire all the epic
parts about it as well. Most of all, make sure you tell a good story—that’s all
anyone wants to read anyways. And a good story is all I want to hear when you
tell me about your bday, so don’t let me down. Can’t wait til you all come to
Southeast Asia post grad, it’s gonna be jokes.
Much Love,
Bechler

## **26. Sandy Bole**

Son, I'm sorry for being such a distant father lately. I am so proud of what you
have achieved and absolutely amazed by your performance to get to NCAA's on your
last year of competing. You are graduating to a new stage of life and I am
stoked for all the fun you are about to experience. As Soprano once rapped
"La vie ne se respire qu'une seule fois. Le bonheur, ca se vit sans aucunes
lois." Enjoy your birthday and the remaining weeks at Princeton.
Joyeux anniversaire,
Ton papa

## **27. Katrin**

Happy Birthday Sam!!! Its been awesome getting to know you better this year.
Thanks so much for all the hilarious memories and awesome post games.

## **28. Charlie Minns**

Happy Birthday Sam! Thank you for being such a huge inspiration, both in and out
of the pool; you've been a huge influence on my life here and I'm incredibly
grateful. Have a wonderful birthday and break, looking forward to the Spring ❤️

## **29. Jeff Williamson**

Dear Sam,
It appears that you are now one year older relative to the last time I saw you.
This is good news, but also quite terrifying. You’re almost done with
University; you’re almost an “adult.” I’ve been told that this letter is
supposed to capture one of my favorite memories with you, but honestly, I can’t
think of a singular one that is superior to the others. This is indeed more good
news because I can now make this an ode (of sorts) to friendship.

Our friendship has been contextualized in diverse settings, and as such, I have
had the pleasure of becoming friends with you in a meaningful manner.
Oftentimes, and especially in college, friendships are formed through drunken
stupors—understandings become limited to superficial conversations. This is
fine, and does have its place in society, but I am glad that this was not the
case for us as it was for many people I met at school. I shall now briefly list
a few of these contexts.

PUCSDT: I always admired your ability to “dive” into new things with so much
ease. I know it was far from easy, but your determination and confidence was
impressive. I’m glad you stuck with it throughout the four years in spite of the
setbacks you faced.

Zete: Nothing brings me more joy in this sphere than knowing that you didn’t do
KA. Some of the moments we had in Zete were sublime; others filled us with an
ever more present existential dread, and some moments were best described as
Kunderaean (Milan Kundera) hedonism. Nonetheless, all of them were enjoyable
with you by my side.

Academia: You’re one smart cookie, keep up the good work and go save those
lives.

I realize that one of my biggest—out of many—flaws is my inability to stay in
proper touch with those I deeply care about. Part of this is selfishness,
knowing that I can pick up with them right where I left off, but the other part
is situational. From a background of moving, I know how impermanent friendship
can seem and often be. There are people, however, that have reshaped that toxic
paradigm; you, my friend, are one of those people. So please accept my apologies
that I have not been in touch, and know that I treasure you as a human and as a
good friend. You’re a remarkable and inspiring character, and I can only wish
you the happiest of birthdays. May your step always be light, your heart always
full, and your head always open.

“I do not wish to treat friendship daintily, but with roughest courage. When
they are real, they are not glass thread or frost-work, but the solidest thing
we know.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson

Always with love,
Jeff
