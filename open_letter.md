# An Open Letter To My BF On His Taylor Swift Birthday

Happy 22nd birthday, my love.

Believe it or not, this idea has been brewing for almost 2 years now -- I was just waiting for the right moment to execute. Your 22nd birthday seemed like the right time; it’s your last birthday at Princeton, it’s a great number, it’s kind of our 2nd anniversary, and of course, it’s the one night of anyone’s life that they are recommended -- nay, required -- to scream taylor swift at the top of their lungs (a position which I know you find yourself in on most days, but this time is extra special). Above all else, this is going to be an unbelievably special year for you, full of bittersweet endings and exciting new beginnings. I know 22 is going to bring so many incredible things for you, so I wanted to give you a gift that is as special as this year will be.

I don’t know if you recall, but a few years ago we saw the rise of the horror that was the odyssey online, featuring some of the worst “original content” of any media platform of our time. That summer -- 2015, when our friendship truly blossomed -- the two of us hatched a plan -- we’d buy another domain, “theiliadonline,” and create a knock-off website to make fun of all the sorority betches who wrote those obnoxious articles. We were so pumped about it -- we had all of these big plans to write sarcastic articles anonymously and make it a thing with all of our spare time (hah). We even went so far as to buy the domain, which of course we did nothing with, because we both have lives; but every year I got an email asking if I wanted to refresh our ownership of the domain, and every year I’ve decided to do it. Because even though nothing ever came of it, that idea wasn’t just our baby, but also it was a testament to our weird and wonderful friendship -- a friendship that is 3.5 years old now (!!!), and is the most treasured friendship I was lucky enough to find at princeton.

I’ve been thinking about doing something with that domain for a long time, but I’ve never known what (nor have I had the time to figure something out). A few months ago, this idea came to me. I would make a seemingly obnoxious Odyssey-esque article, like “13 Summer Struggles Only Thick Girls Understand,” or “The 10 Commandments of College Every Student Must Obey To Just Be Normal” (these are both very real articles, btw. Smh). Except my article was going to be called “X Ways To Tell If Your Friends Give A Shit About You,” and it was going to have X messages from your X closest friends, so that you can see how loved you really are.

Anyhow -- I’m not sure I needed to give you the full explanation, I think you remember the Iliad Online concept as well as I do -- but I figured I’d remind you just in case, because you know I like to explain my gifts, and I wanted it to make complete sense to you and anyone else who might like an explanation.

I’m sure there are many people from before my time who are missing from the list, but
I did my best to get a hold of most the important people. These messages are meant to be just for you, and I did my best not to read any of them too closely, but it was wonderful to see all the different people who love you so dearly, and how each of them expressed that in their own way. In the spirit of finishing the list, I wanted to share some of my favorite memories of and with you.

When I first met you at denunzio and thought I was probably a way better trampolinist than you ever were, then googled you after practice and immediately became your #1 fangirl. I dont know if you know this but every time you did a dive for that first month at practice I would fan myself when you were underwater -- the team loved it.

When I was on training trip sophomore year and you weren’t there and I realized that I missed you even though I’d known you less than a month. I was standing on 1-meter and I turned to Lisa and I was like “I miss chachacha” and everyone was like “dang that’s a great nickname” and you became Chacha ever since (Ok I know it’s not an original nickname I just like to think I’m responsible for it. Let me have this!!!)

When I found out that Meaghan O’Neill had totaled my car and it was Valentines Day and Cottage initiations and I was so incredibly upset. I didn’t know what to do but I knew you were at Cloister and for some reason I needed to see you -- so I walked over and we sat on the couches up those 2 stairs next to the entrance and I cried to you about my car getting wrecked. And you hugged me close and told me that you and Olivia had kind of broken up and that you were really sad too. And we just sat there and were there for each other in our mutual misery

When Helber pushed me over at the men’s team pregame and I was so furious -- and again I called you because it just seemed like the right thing to do and you came and sat on a bench in prospect garden with me and calmed me down. We kissed for the first time that night, sitting on that bench.

When we spent 3 days in June of 2015 making the freshman diver survey. You were in France and I was in MN and we just went HAM on a google doc together. To this day that is one of my most laughter-filled memories -- and your Kanye portion of the survey will forever make me laugh.

When for an entire summer you would call me each and every time you heard the song Trap Queen on the radio
When you would get drunk your sophomore fall and tell me you were in love with me and I didn’t really believe you but it still made me feel so special.

When you facetimed me one night over winter break at the exact right moment and I knew I was in love with you too.

When we were finally both drunk and in the right place at the right time on dean’s date of that year and you told me you were in love with me, but this time I said it back. And then you asked me to come meet you in your room but then you fell asleep -- and the next morning we got brunch at Wu with your Day 1’s and Will mentioned passing out and you looked me in the face and said “sometimes people accidentally fall asleep when they really, really don’t want to.” And then you gave me the moose mittens as a belated xmas gift and it is still one of my favorite gifts i’ve ever gotten.

When on Valentines day of 2016, exactly a year after we’d both had our hearts broken, you found me on the dance floor at Cottage initiations and made a very convincing case for yourself.

When we skied together for the first time over spring break and you shouted “holy shit you can shred!” when you skied past me and it made me so happy. And then we all got drunk together in the hot tub and while everyone was showering we were cuddling on the bed and you said it was the best day of your life and I realized it was one of the best days of mine too. And then we saw meaghan naked hahahah

When you got drunk one night that summer and texted me at 2 am that I was in your myspace top 5 before we’d even met, and that you thought I was Neo. It was the best message I’ve ever woken up to. I read it and just layed there, smiling like an idiot and hugging my phone.

When you came to visit me in NYC that summer and we documented it all on a shitty little disposable camera.

When I came to see you in Colorado and you showed me your roots. We went on our first Chick-fil-a date, you taught me how to lead climb, you made me breakfast and then held my hand across the finish line of my first 14-er.
