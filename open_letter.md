<h1><div class="article2_head"> An Open Letter To My BF On His Taylor Swift Birthday</div></h1>

Happy 22nd birthday, my love.

Believe it or not, this idea has been brewing for over a year now. I've been waiting for the right moment to execute, and your 22nd birthday seemed like as good a time as any: it’s your last birthday at Princeton, it’s a great number, it’s kind of our 2nd anniversary, and of course, it’s the one night of anyone’s life that they are recommended -- nay, required -- to scream taylor swift at the top of their lungs (a position which I know you find yourself in on most nights, but this time it's extra special). Above all else, I know 22 is going to bring so many incredible things for you, and I wanted to give you a gift that is as special as this year will be.

I'm sure you recall the rise of the horror that was The Odyssey Online, a website featuring some of the most obnoxious “original content” of any platform of our time. That summer (2015, when our friendship truly blossomed) the two of us hatched a plan: we’d buy a domain, “theiliadonline,” and make a knock-off website - the sole purpose of which would be to make fun of the sorority betches writing those atrocious articles. We had big plans to spend our spare time writing sarcastic articles anonymously and make it a real thing (our first million dollar idea!!). We even went so far as to buy the domain, which of course we did nothing with, because we both had lives and zero spare time; but every year I got an email asking if I wanted to refresh our ownership of the domain, and every year I’ve decided to do it. Because even though nothing ever came of it, that idea wasn’t only our baby, but also it was a testament to our weird and wonderful friendship - a friendship that is 3.5 years old now (!!!), and is the most treasured friendship I was lucky enough to find at Princeton.

I’ve been thinking about doing something with that domain for a long time, but I’ve never known what (nor have I really had the time to figure something out). A few months ago, this idea came to me. I would make a seemingly obnoxious Odyssey-esque article, like “13 Summer Struggles Only Thick Girls Understand,” or “The 10 Commandments of College Every Student Must Obey To Just Be Normal” (these are both very real articles currently sitting on the home page of the Odyssey, by the way. Smh). Except instead of actually being obnoxious, my article was going to be called “30 Ways To Tell If Your Friends Give A Shit About You,” and it was going to have 30 messages from your 30 closest friends, so that you can see how loved you really are. And then I would post that article on our domain and make it look just like The Odyssey - finally doing something with our 3 year old brainchild.

So here it is - I’m not sure I needed to give you the full explanation, I think you remember the Iliad Online concept as well as I do - but I figured I’d remind you just in case. You know I like to explain my gifts, and I wanted it to make complete sense to you (and anyone else who might like an explanation).

I know there are many people from who are missing from the list, but I did my best to get a hold of most of the important ones. These messages are meant to be just for you, and I did my best not to read any of them too closely, but it was wonderful to see all the different people who love you so much. In the spirit of actually finishing the list, I wanted to share some of my favorite memories of and with you. So here goes: 30 memories from me to go with the 30 notes from your 30 closest friends.

1. When I first met you at Denunzio and thought I was probably a way better trampolinist than you ever were. Then I googled you after practice and immediately became your \#1 fangirl. I don't know if you know this but every time you did a dive for that first month at practice I would literally fan myself when you were underwater -- the team thought it was hilarious.

2. When I was on training trip that year and you weren’t there and I realized that I missed you even though I’d only known you for like two weeks. I was standing on 1-meter and I turned to Lisa and I was like, “I miss chachacha.” And then everyone was like “dang that’s a great nickname” and you were Chacha ever since. (I know it’s not really an original nickname I just like to think I’m responsible for it. Let me have this!!!)

3. When I found out that Meaghan O’Neill had totaled my car and it was Valentines Day and Cottage initiations and I was so incredibly upset. I didn’t know what to do but I knew you were at Cloister and for some reason I needed to see you -- so I walked over and we sat on the couches near the entrance and I cried to you about my car getting wrecked. And you hugged me close and told me that you and Olivia had kind of broken up and that you were really sad too. And we just sat there in our mutual misery but at least we had each other.

4. When Helber pushed me over at the men’s team pregame and I was so furious -- and again I called you because it just seemed like the right thing to do. And then you came and sat on a bench in Prospect Garden with me and calmed me down. We kissed for the first time that night, sitting on that bench.

5. When we spent 3 days in June of 2015 making the freshman diver survey. You were in France and I was in Minnesota and we just went HAM on a google doc together.

6. When for an entire summer you would call me every single time you heard the song Trap Queen on the radio.

7. Every time you drunkenly told me you were in love with me. And then when you facetimed me one night over winter break at the right moment and I knew I was in love with you too.

8. When it was Dean's Date of that year and we were both tipsy and in the right place at the right time. And again you told me you were in love with me, but this time I said it back. And then we kind of just sat there and neither of us knew what to do. You were called to a pledge task but you asked me to come meet you in your room after - and when I got there you had fallen asleep. The next morning we got brunch at Wu with your buddies and Will said something about passing out; you looked me in the face and said “sometimes people accidentally fall asleep when they really, really don’t want to.”

9. The very convincing argument you made on the Cottage dance floor on Valentines day of 2016, exactly one year after that awful night at Cloister.

10. When we skied together for the first time over spring break and you said, “oh my god, you can shred!” when you skied by me. And then we all got drunk together in the hot tub and while everyone was showering we were sitting on the bed together and you said it was the best day of your life. And I realized it was one of the best days of mine too. (And then we saw Meaghan naked hahahah).

11. When we went bowling and on the way back we both requested the same flume song at the exact same time. And then we went to disi-ball and on the way home you said you'd like to start calling me your girlfriend, if that was cool with me (It was).

12. The wonderful and hilarious TRAMPOLINE-THEMED surprise birthday party you planned for my 21st birthday.

13. When we watched the reunions fireworks on the rooftop of Forbes with a bottle of Champagne and nobody else.

14. When you texted me really late one night right after the school year ended. I still have it saved. It was the best message I’ve ever woken up to. I read it in bed and just laid there, smiling like an idiot and hugging my phone.

15. When we celebrated clayms and the fourth of July with your family in Massachusetts.

16. When I came to see you in Colorado and we climbed Quandary. Flume and our Chick-fil-a date and learning to lead climb were all cool too, but the 14er was my favorite part. You woke up early to make me breakfast in bed. And then afterwards when we climbed you waited for me just before the summit so that we could cross the finish line together, hand in hand.

17. When I got to campus for frosh week senior year and I was helping Colleen get her stuff out of my car, and you reached in through the open passenger window and put your hand on my back to say hello. You didn't have to say a word and I knew it was you.

18. When we were both over the moon while eating oreos, and they turned your teeth black and neither of us could stop laughing. I was trying to film you and you didn't want your black teeth on camera so you were cracking up with your mouth closed.

19. When I got so freaked out by my back spasm that I went to McCosh really late one night and you came all the way from Henry to sit there with me, and then walked me home.

20. One of the first members nights of the year when we had a library dance floor but no one was there and you and I took it over. We put on waves by Kanye and danced just the two of us. And then when the song ended a poor KA pledge who'd been trapped behind the DJ table the whole time had to awkwardly make his exit.

21. When we ditched our dates after date night on training trip and snuggled in your hotel room instead.

22. When I watched you school Caroline Joyce in the ping pong tournament.

23. When I watched you qualify for zones for the first time.

24. When you got your pledges to ask me to Gatsby night at members dinner with a corny song and a dozen roses.

25. When I competed 205 at HYP and you watched the video over and over and over again because you were proud of me.

26. When we went to Ivy-Cottage night and you were allowed to drink but I was dry but we still spent the night out having a good time. I didn't realize I could have so much fun being sober and surrounded by drunk people, but with you there it didn't matter.

27. When I had the worst Ivies ever but I got a sweet text from you at initiations on Saturday night with a picture of you pointing to the place where you decided to make your move. And also when you made the Danny tshirts. Classic.

28. When we went to ZBB over spring break after a perfect day of skiing. After we got there you and I slipped away from our friends, just the two of us. We found a little spot of our own and you had your arm around me the whole time.

29. When we post-gamed in my room after a sunday funday with Carol and Jankow and blasted middle school raps and Kendrick Lamar. Humble came on and you and I both separately dabbed every time he said "Ay" in the song (and Carol was dying in the background).

30. When we finally got a minute alone on graduation weekend and we were cuddling in my bed. It had been a long and shitty day and when we were laying there together you told me how proud you were of me, and how sad you were that I was leaving and it was everything I needed to hear.

31. Every time I've come back to you after being gone these last few months.

I added an extra one because it's important. I know your 21st year hasn't been easy on either of us, but the feeling I get every time I come home and wake up next to you again makes it all worth it. I am so grateful to be with someone who is as supportive as you are. I know a lot of people would have never agreed to something like this, and I can't tell you how lucky I feel that you were accepting of it. In my loneliest moments this past year I was reminded how wonderful it is that I have someone to talk to -- someone who misses me and cares what I'm doing. And when the going got rough, I passed the time by imagining how incredible it would be when I got to see you again. I'm not sure I could've made it through this last year without you. And as hard as it has been to say goodbye every time, I've learned to appreciate that sadness because I know it means that we have something really special. But, with that said, SCREW the goodbyes!!!!! And cheers to 22 because I have a feeling we'll be doing way less of them 😏

So I don't know about you, but here's to feelin' 22. I am so proud of all the things you've accomplished so far and I can't wait to see what's in store. Thanks for letting me tag along for the ride. I hope you enjoy this birthday as much as I enjoyed your interpretation of the moth's voice from the fellowship of the ring <3

I love you 🦃
